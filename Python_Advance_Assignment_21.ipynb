        "\n",
        "A probability distribution is a mathematical function or a description that defines the likelihood of different outcomes or values occurring in a random process or experiment. It provides information about the probabilities associated with various events or values. While the individual outcomes are indeed random and unpredictable, the distribution describes the overall pattern of how these outcomes are likely to occur."

Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated using deterministic algorithms that simulate randomness but are based on an initial value called a seed. While pseudo-random numbers are not truly random, they are considered \"good enough\" for many applications because they exhibit statistical properties similar to true randomness and are computationally efficient."

        "In the short term, a probability distribution might exhibit variability and randomness, making it difficult to predict specific outcomes. However, as the number of trials or observations grows, the distribution tends to stabilize and approach its expected pattern. This phenomenon is described by the law of large numbers. As the number of trials increases, the distribution becomes more consistent and closely resembles the theoretical distribution. This is why, over a large number of trials, the observed outcomes tend to align with the predicted probabilities from the distribution."
