        "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that facilitates the organization and structuring of code by representing real-world entities and their interactions as objects. OOP promotes the use of classes and objects to encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into reusable and modular components. This approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and allows for easier abstraction and modeling of complex systems.\n",

It defines the structure and behavior that instances will have, but it is not an instance itself. An instance object, on the other hand, is a specific realization of a class, created using the class constructor. Instances have their own unique data (attributes) and can invoke the methods defined in the class. In short, a class object defines the structure, while an instance object represents a specific instance of that structure.\n",

When you call an instance method, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument (self) to the method. This allows the method to access and manipulate the attributes and behaviors specific to that instance. It's a way for methods to interact with the instance's data and perform actions that are relevant to that particular instance."
