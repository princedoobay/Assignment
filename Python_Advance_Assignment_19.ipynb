        "Python supports encapsulation to a certain extent through naming conventions and access control mechanisms. While Python doesn't have strict private or protected access modifiers like some other languages, it uses naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of variables and methods. By convention, a variable or method name starting with an underscore `(_)` is considered \"protected\" and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. However, this is a soft convention, and the variables can still be accessed if needed. For stricter encapsulation, you can use double underscores `(__)` as a prefix, which performs name mangling to make it harder to access from outside the class. Nevertheless, Python's philosophy encourages developers to use responsible and transparent encapsulation practices rather than enforcing strict access control."

In such cases, Python will check the reflection methods of the other object to see if it can handle the operation. You do not need reflection methods if both objects involved in the operation have the corresponding methods defined.
