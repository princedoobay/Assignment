        "\n",
        "- Error Handling: Exception processing is primarily used for error handling in programming. When an unexpected or exceptional situation occurs during the execution of a program, instead of terminating abruptly, the program can raise an exception. This allows the program to gracefully handle errors, display helpful error messages, and take appropriate actions to recover from the error or terminate gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Input Validation: When accepting input from users or external sources, exception processing can be used to validate the input. For example, if a program expects an integer as input but receives a string, it can raise a ValueError or a custom exception to indicate that the input is invalid. This helps ensure that the program operates on valid data and avoids potential issues caused by incorrect input.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Resource Management: Exception processing is also essential for managing resources like files, database connections, or network connections. If an error occurs while accessing or using a resource, the program can raise an exception and perform necessary cleanup operations (e.g., closing files or releasing network connections) using exception handling mechanisms to prevent resource leaks and ensure proper resource management."

        "If you don't do something extra to treat an exception, it will propagate up the call stack until it is either caught and handled by an exception handler or until it reaches the top level of the program, where it may cause the program to terminate abruptly. When an unhandled exception reaches the top level of the program, the interpreter will display an error message, known as a traceback, showing the sequence of calls that led to the unhandled exception and the type of the exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, if an exception is not explicitly caught and handled within the code, the default behavior is to terminate the program and print the traceback, which helps developers identify the cause of the exception."

        "- Try-Except Block: Use a try-except block to catch and handle the exception. By wrapping the code that may raise an exception inside a try block, you can specify the actions to be taken in the corresponding except block when that particular exception occurs. This way, the program can gracefully recover from the exception and continue executing the rest of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Try-Except-Else Block: You can add an optional else block after the except block. Code inside the else block will be executed only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. This can be useful for defining actions that should be performed when no exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Try-Finally Block: Besides using try-except, you can also use try-finally blocks. Code inside the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup operations, like releasing resources, that should always be performed.\n",
        "\n",
