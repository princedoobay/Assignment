        "\n",
        "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending existing classes or modules at runtime. This is often done by directly altering the source code of the module or class, or by adding new methods or attributes to them. While monkey patching can be a powerful technique for adding functionality or fixing issues in third-party libraries or modules, it should be used with caution. Improper or excessive monkey patching can lead to unexpected behavior, compatibility issues, and difficult-to-maintain code.\n",

However, it does not create copies of the referred objects themselves. In other words, the copy and the original object share some of the nested objects. Shallow copy can be performed using the `copy()` function or the `copy.copy()` method from the copy module.\n",
        "- Deep Copy: A deep copy of an object creates a new object and recursively creates copies of all the nested objects referenced by the original object. As a result, the copy is fully independent of the original object and its nested objects. Deep copy can be performed using the `copy.deepcopy()` method from the `copy` module."

        "A generator comprehension is a concise way to create a generator in Python. It is similar to a list comprehension, but instead of creating a list, it creates an iterator (generator) that produces values lazily as they are needed. This can be more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. Generator comprehensions use the same syntax as list comprehensions, but they are enclosed in parentheses instead of square brackets.\n",
