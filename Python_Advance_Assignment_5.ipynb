        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is a feature found in some object-oriented programming languages, including Python. It allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple parent classes. In other words, a class can have more than one immediate superclass. When a class inherits from multiple classes, it inherits all the methods and attributes defined in each of the parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if Class A and Class B are parent classes, and Class C inherits from both A and B, then Class C has access to the attributes and methods of both A and B.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, multiple inheritance can lead to complexities in the method resolution order (MRO) and can cause ambiguity when the same method or attribute is present in multiple parent classes. To address this, some programming languages, including Python, use a method resolution order algorithm (C3 linearization) to determine the order in which the parent classes' methods are called."

        "\n",
        "Delegation is a design pattern in object-oriented programming where an object forwards specific behavior or method calls to another object. Instead of inheriting the behavior directly, the delegating object holds a reference to another object (the delegate) and invokes methods on the delegate to perform certain operations. This allows for code reuse and composition, as the delegating object can use the functionality of the delegate without inheriting its entire implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Delegation promotes a more flexible and modular approach to building classes, as it allows objects to collaborate with other objects to achieve specific functionalities. It also avoids the issues related to multiple inheritance, as delegation allows the reuse of functionality without creating complex inheritance hierarchies."

        "\n",
        "Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes rather than inheriting from them. In composition, the class that contains the objects is responsible for managing their behavior and interactions. It allows for creating complex objects by combining simpler, more focused classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you have a class called Car that needs to have an Engine, Wheels, and Chassis, you can use composition to include instances of these classes within the Car class, rather than creating a separate inheritance hierarchy for each part.\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition provides better code organization and reduces coupling between classes. It also supports the \"has-a\" relationship, where a class \"has\" other objects as its components, promoting code reuse and easier maintenance."
