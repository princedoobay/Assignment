In other words, if a class is an instance of a metaclass, that metaclass determines how the class behaves, how its attributes are handled, and how its methods are inherited. Metaclasses provide a way to customize the creation and behavior of classes, somewhat similar to how classes customize the behavior of instances."

The distinction between class-level behavior and instance-level behavior is important to keep in mind when working with decorators and metaclasses."
