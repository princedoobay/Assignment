    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used in bagging, which involves randomly sampling instances from the original training dataset with replacement to create multiple subsets. It is an essential step in bagging and helps generate diverse subsets for training individual base models.\n",
    "The process of bootstrapping involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample Creation: For each bootstrap sample, a subset of the same size as the original training data is created by randomly selecting instances with replacement. Replacement means that each instance has an equal chance of being selected, and the same instance can appear multiple times in a bootstrap sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subset Variability: The bootstrapped subsets generated through this process are likely to have some common instances but also differ in terms of the instances they contain. The bootstrapping process introduces variability and diversity among the subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating multiple bootstrapped subsets, bagging ensures that each base model is trained on a different set of instances, which introduces diversity and reduces the correlation among the base models. This diversity is beneficial for improving the ensemble's performance by reducing overfitting and increasing robustness."

    "\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble technique that sequentially builds base models, where each subsequent model focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous models. The base models are trained iteratively, and each new model is trained on a modified version of the training data, giving more weight to the instances that were misclassified by the previous models.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Initial Weights: Each instance in the training data is assigned an initial weight.\n",

    "2. Base Model Training: The first base model is trained on the original training data, considering the instance weights. The model predicts the outcomes, and the weights are adjusted based on the misclassifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Instance Weight Update: The instances that were misclassified by the previous model are given higher weights, while the instances that were correctly classified receive lower weights. This places more emphasis on the challenging instances, allowing subsequent models to focus on them.\n",

    "4. Sequential Model Building: Additional base models are trained iteratively, each using a modified version of the training data with updated instance weights. The new models focus on correcting the misclassifications made by the ensemble of previous models.\n",

Meta-Model Training: The predictions from the base models, along with the original features, are used as inputs to train a meta-model (e.g., a linear regression model, a neural network, or a random forest).

    "- Improved Predictive Performance: Ensemble techniques can achieve higher prediction accuracy compared to individual models, especially when the base models are diverse and complementary.\n",
