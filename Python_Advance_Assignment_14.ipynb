While it may seem similar to regular assignment, using `+=` can indeed lead to faster results at runtime in some cases. This is especially true when dealing with mutable objects like lists, where the `+=` operator modifies the existing object in place, rather than creating a new one. This can lead to more efficient memory usage and potentially faster execution, as compared to creating a new object and reassigning."
