    "Both def statements and lambda expressions are used to create functions in Python. However, they differ in syntax and in the way they are used.\n",

    "A `def` statement is a complete function definition that consists of a name, arguments, and a body of statements. It is used to define a reusable piece of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `lambda` expression, on the other hand, is a single expression that is used to create an anonymous function. It does not have a name, and it can be used inline as part of a larger expression. Lambdas are typically used for short, simple operations that do not require a complete function definition.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Concise syntax: Lambdas can be written in a single line of code and do not require the use of a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Readability: In some cases, a `lambda` expression can make code more readable by allowing you to define a function inline, where it is used, instead of defining it elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility: Lambdas can be used in many contexts, such as sorting, filtering, and mapping data structures, and can also be passed as arguments to other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Memory efficiency: Because `lambda` expressions are anonymous, they do not take up space in memory like named functions do, making them more memory-efficient in some situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, `lambda` expressions can be a powerful tool for creating small, reusable functions quickly and easily, improving code readability, and enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of your code."
