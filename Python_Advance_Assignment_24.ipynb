For example, if a module has submodules or subpackages, you might import specific functions or classes from those submodules using separate import statements. This can make your code more organized and improve clarity."

        "To avoid circular importing and mutual dependencies between modules, you can reorganize your code and separate concerns. One approach is to move common functionality to a third module that both original modules can import. Alternatively, you can use delayed imports or import within functions, so the circular dependencies are resolved at runtime when the functions are called."

It is a list of names that are considered part of the module's public API when the `from module import *` statement is used.
