        "Text files and binary files differ in how they store and interpret data. Text files contain human-readable characters encoded in a specific character set (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8), with each character represented by a distinct byte value. They are suitable for storing textual information like code, configuration files, or documents. Binary files, on the other hand, store data in its raw binary format, not limited to human-readable characters. These files can hold various types of data, such as images, audio, video, or executable files. Binary files store data as sequences of bytes without concern for character encoding, making them more efficient for certain types of data storage and manipulation.\n",

Binary files might be chosen when precise control over data representation, memory layout, or data compression is required.\n",

Different systems have different byte orders (big-endian or little-endian), and reading/writing binary data across systems with different endianness can result in data corruption or misinterpretation. To ensure portability, you might need to implement endian conversion. Additionally, managing data types and byte alignment can be error-prone and lead to compatibility issues between different versions of Python or between different systems.\n",

When the code execution exits the `with` block, the file is automatically closed, even if an exception is raised within the block. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures clean and reliable file handling.\n",

When you write a line of text to a file using methods like `write()`, Python does not automatically append a newline character unless you explicitly include it in the string you are writing. To ensure consistent behavior, you need to manage newlines explicitly when reading and writing text files in Python."
